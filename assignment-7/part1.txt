Q. 1: What is client-side and server-side in web development, and what is the main difference between the two?

A. 1: A client-side is the frontend part and server-side is the backend part of web development.

The difference between them is that the client-side will request many different kind of data/information/services from server-side.
The server-side will receive the valid requests, then check the request for validity, data types, data format, security, access control etc using middleware and if everything checks out, it will access the database for CRUD operation and finally send and appropriate response with data (if necessary) to the client side.
The client-side will now receive the response and then handle the response for showing any updates to the user.
